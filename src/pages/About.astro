            Hi there! My name is <strong class="text-sky-300">parisa saraf</strong>, and I'm a software engineer with 1
            years of experience in the industry. I'm passionate about building
            high-quality software that solves real-world problems and makes people's
            lives easier.
          </p><br />
          <p>
            My expertise lies in full-stack development, with a focus on web
            applications. I'm proficient in a variety of programming languages,
            including JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, and I'm comfortable working with
            tools and frameworks like React, Node.js, and Django.
          </p><br />
          <p>
            In addition to my technical skills, I pride myself on my ability to
            collaborate with team members and communicate effectively with
            stakeholders. I'm a natural problem solver and enjoy tackling complex
            challenges.
          </p><br />
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking in the mountains or playing
            guitar in my local band. I'm always looking for new opportunities to work
            on exciting projects, so if you're interested in collaborating, please
            feel free to get in touch. Thanks for stopping by!
